TODO list for libgpiod

==========

This document contains the list of things I'd like to have in libgpiod before
declaring it "mostly feature-complete". If anyone wants to help, this can
serve as the starting point.

==========

* implement a simple daemon for controlling GPIOs in C together with a client
  program

This is by far the lowest priority task. Similarly as with the dbus daemon:
the goal is to provide a centralized agent controlling GPIOs with a simple
interface consisting of a command line client communicating with the server
over unix sockets.

In this case however the goal is to have as few dependencies as possible. This
is because for some small systems dbus is overkill. Since we won't be using any
standardized protocol, it will take much more effort to implement it correctly.

----------

* improve gpioset --interactive tab completion

The existing tab completion uses libedit's readline emulation layer which
has a few limitations, including not being able to correctly handle quoted
line names and being disabled when stdin/stdout are not a tty (which makes
testing with gpio-tools-test.bash using coproc problematic).

One approach that could address both these problems is to bypass the readline
emulation and use the libedit API (histedit.h) directly.
